# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The Godot project lives at the repository root alongside `project.godot`; opening that file boots the editor. Editor metadata stays in `.godot/`—never hand-edit or commit transient cache entries. Place gameplay scenes under `res://scenes/`, scripts in `res://scripts/`, and shared art or audio in `res://assets/`; create these folders if they are not yet present. Keep resource names descriptive (for example, `res://scenes/ForgeHub.tscn`) so dependencies remain searchable. Support files generated by the importer (`*.import`) are tracked automatically—leave them untouched.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install the Godot CLI once per workstation so the `godot` command resolves. On macOS, `brew install --cask godot` then `ln -sf /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot /usr/local/bin/godot`; on other platforms, use the official download and add the binary folder to `PATH`.
- `godot --editor --path .` launches the project in the Godot editor with all tooling.
- `godot --path . --run res://scenes/Main.tscn` starts the main scene directly for a quick smoke test; substitute another scene when iterating locally.
- `godot --headless --path . --run res://tests/TestSuite.tscn` executes automated test scenes or GUT suites without rendering; ensure the target scene exists before running.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write gameplay logic in GDScript 4 with 4-space indentation; let the Godot script formatter (Editor > Edit > Format) handle whitespace. Use PascalCase for classes and scenes (`ForgeHubController`), snake_case for variables and functions (`spawn_wave()`), and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for exported constants. Keep each script focused on a single node; prefer autoload singletons for cross-cutting systems. Commit both `.tscn` and `.gd` files together so node paths stay in sync.

## Testing Guidelines
Adopt scene-based or GUT-driven tests stored in `res://tests/`. Mirror the production scene hierarchy when possible (e.g., `res://tests/scenes/`) and suffix suites with `_test.tscn` or `_test.gd`. Run suites headlessly using the command above and block merges until failures are resolved. When adding new gameplay features, include an automated regression or document a manual test plan in the PR description.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing history: short, present-tense summaries such as `add forge wave spawner`. Group related asset and script changes in a single commit. Pull requests should include a concise overview, linked issue or design note, and before/after visuals or GIFs for user-facing changes. Call out any editor or project-setting modifications explicitly so reviewers can validate them in Godot.
